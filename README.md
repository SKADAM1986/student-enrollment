# Design a Enrollment system for school students, with self capability to enroll for any class for any semester 

Roles:

Admin

    Admin can create new Semester Record in the Student Enrollment System.
  
    Admin can create new Student record based on studentâ€™s request. Once registered Student Id will be generated and shared with Student for future enrollments.
  
Student

    Students should be able to enroll themselves for classes during available semester options.
  
    Students should be able to withdraw enrollment for particular class and Semester
  
Restraints:

    1.	School administrators can create and modify student records but never delete them
  
    2.	Each class a fixed credit/unit.  Some harder classes might be 4 credits while easier ones could be 2 or 3 credits.
  
    3.	Each student is only allowed to be enrolled in a maximum of 20 credits for each semester

# Download Source Code on Local Machine:

Download source code from git-hub web page.

      https://github.com/SKADAM1986/student-enrollment

OR

Travese to directory where you want to download the code

With command line, Execute below command to clone repository on local machine

      https://github.com/SKADAM1986/student-enrollment.git

After clone/download, Verify "student-enrollment" folder with source code is downloaded.

Verify Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are downloaded in student-enrollment folder


# Build and Deploy Steps for Spring boot Application on local machine:

Verification: MySQL should be up and running and application properties should be configure with mysql url.

To Build Spring boot application:

mvn clean install

1. Compile Code
2. Run all JUnit tests
3. Add dependencies
4. package jar file

To run Spring boot application:

     Run jar file as Java application :
     
        command: java -jar <jar name>
        
      OR
      
        command: mvn spring-boot:run

# Build and Deploy Steps for Spring boot Application using Docker:

Travese to directory where you want to download the code (student-enrollment)
  
  Run below command:
  
  docker-compose up --build -d
  
  Above command should execute below on Docket container.
  
     1. Download code from Git reposiotory
     2. Build code with maven
     3. Run jar as Java application
     4. Get latest image of MySQL 8.0
     5. Install MySQL in seperate container
     6. Create required database schema as per configuration mentioned in the source code
